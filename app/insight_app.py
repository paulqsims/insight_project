st.success('Five stars: Superior. These are industry-leading, world-class products that contain an intriguing amount or combination of research-proven ingredients. \n Four stars: Excellent. These are some of the best products around but have minor formulary, aesthetic, or performance issues that can affect a decision to purchase or results youâ€™ll see. Three stars: Average. May have certain issues such as a lack of key ingredients or a more basic or one-note formula, but might still be worth considering, especially if the price is low. Two stars: Below average. These products are disappointing on many levels, from formula to packaging or value for the money. Not worth strong consideration. One star: Poor. An irritant-laden or otherwise disappointing formula, bad performance, poor packaging, or a combination of these make such products a must to avoid.')
