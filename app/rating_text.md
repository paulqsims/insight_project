These are industry-leading, world-class products that contain an intriguing amount or combination of research-proven ingredients.

#### Four stars: Excellent

These are some of the best products around but have minor formulary, aesthetic, or performance issues that can affect a decision to purchase or results youâ€™ll see.

#### Three stars: Average

May have certain issues such as a lack of key ingredients or a more basic or one-note formula, but might still be worth considering, especially if the price is low.

#### Two stars: Below average
These products are disappointing on many levels, from formula to packaging or value for the money. Not worth strong consideration.

#### One star: Poor

An irritant-laden or otherwise disappointing formula, bad performance, poor packaging, or a combination of these make such products a must to avoid.
