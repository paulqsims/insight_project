WHAT IT IS: Getting the basics right can be so difficult but it doesn't have to be! The Peach & Lily Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser makes it so easy to get the basics right, cleansing skin down to its pores without stripping skin dry or causing irritation. Formulated with soothing ingredients like chamomile and camellia extracts and without things like sulfates or toxins or animal testing, this gentle face wash starts as a clear gel and lathers into a soft, milky foam, helping dissolve light, everyday makeup and deeply cleansing skin, while a pH of 5.5 helps keep your natural skin barrier intact. You won't have to think twice about how to start your routine on the right note.

RECOMMENDED FOR:
All skin types
Acne-prone, mature, and/or sensitive skin in particular
Irritation, redness, and inflammation
Rough texture and dullness
Dehydrated, uncomfortable tightness

WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU: Peach & Lily's Power Calm Hydrating Cleanser starts with Deionized Water, water that's been run through a filtration system to remove mineral ions, leaving only clean, pure water. Camellia, Chamomile, and Centella Asiatica Extracts help soothe skin, while Peach Extract brings its wealth of vitamins and minerals to help nourish and brighten skin, so skin is left deeply cleansed without being stripped dry or irritated. Formulated without sulfates or toxins, this lightweight, gel cleanser has a pH of 5.5 and a faint herbal scent that imparts a sense of calm, starting any skincare routine on the right, gentle note.

THE MIND BEHIND: Peach & Lily's founder, Alicia Yoon, is a celebrated esthetician and a leading skincare expert. In her experience, when cleansing is done improperly, skin tends to go awry, becoming irritated or producing more oil, while getting cleansing right helps make the rest of a skincare routine much easier because proper cleansing helps keep skin balanced and free of irritation, the skin's natural barrier left intact. With this in mind, Alicia worked with leading labs in Korea to develop a cleanser that would not only cleanse gently but also help hydrate, nourish, and balance skin. Discover the skin-changing benefits of a proper cleanser with Peach & Lily's Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser for yourself!

Clinique Clean Philosophy:

Clinique Formulas:
No parabens.
No phthalates.
No fragrance.
Just happy skin.

Clinique Packaging:
Same great formula, now in more sustainable packaging.
Tube is minimum 39% post-consumer recycled material, 28% plant-derived plastic.
Cap is 25% post-consumer recycled material.
What does post-consumer recycled (PCR) material mean? It's a material (such as a plastic water bottle) that's already been used and would otherwise have been thrown away. This reduces the creation of new plastic waste.¿
What does plant-derived plastic mean? It's made from an agricultural byproduct of processing sugarcane that would otherwise be discarded.

Please note: In an effort to minimize waste, we're first selling through all of our cleansers with the original packaging. That's why you might not receive the newest packaging, but rest assured it's the same great formula inside.
