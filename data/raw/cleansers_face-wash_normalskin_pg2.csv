A Note from the Founders of Ursa Major:

Few things matter as much in life as finding your own true north: navigating towards the places, people and experiences that make you feel truly alive. For us, that meant leaving the big city and moving north to Vermont in search of a healthier, more balanced lifestyle closer to family and the great outdoors. It also meant starting Ursa Major ('The Great Bear' in Latin), our way to help friends (and their friends...) make the switch to delightful, plant-powered skincare. We're confident that our products will help you achieve clear, healthy skin. What you do after that - how you find your true north - is up to you.
