About Indie Lee:

In 2008, Indie Lee was diagnosed with a life-threatening brain tumor that doctors felt could be environmentally derived and attributed to something as simple as what she was putting on her skin. After learning that up to 60% of what we apply to our skin may be absorbed in as little as 26 seconds, Indie had her awakening. She embarked upon a wellness journey to create a clean beauty collection dedicated to inspiring and empowering others to be mindful about what they put on their skin as well as into their bodies.

Sourcing the world's finest ingredients and formulating with the help of leading, like-minded chemists, Indie Lee & Co. intrinsically blends nature and science to bring the most efficacious products to market without sacrificing safety. The brand's mission to provide healthier skincare options is embodied through its undertaking of rigorous testing protocols to ensure clean, high-performance products.
