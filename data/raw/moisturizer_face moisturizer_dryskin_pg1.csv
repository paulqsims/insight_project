$40.00","WHAT IT IS: Matcha isn't just for sipping! Peach & Lily's velvety Matcha Pudding Antioxidant Cream addresses real life problems. If you've ever wondered why you might be seeing premature and rapid signs of aging, you're not alone. Our skin faces increasing stress from heightened pollution, fast-paced stressful lives, excess sun exposure and lack of sleep. All of this leads to free radical damage, which can accelerate signs of aging. This indulgent formula addresses all of this by drenching skin with powerful antioxidants, creating a protective barrier to help fight free radical damage at all layers of the skin. Spiked with Matcha, Cape Lilac Extract, Niacinamide and Adenosine, skin is blasted with antioxidants and brightening and firming ingredients. The delightful pudding texture delivers deep hydration without sitting heavy on the skin. Thank you very Matcha!

RECOMMENDED FOR:
Dehydration (Alicia's Tip: dehydrated skin lacks moisture. Oily skin types can have dehydrated skin, too)
Dark spots, uneven skin tone
Fine lines, wrinkles
Dullness, lack of radiance

WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU: There are few ingredients that rival the antioxidant density of Matcha. Peach & Lily's Matcha Pudding is packed to the brim with this super-charged antioxidant-source so that your skin gets flooded with goodness. The creamy formula is also infused with Niacinamide to help brighten dark spots and even skin tone, while fighting inflammation. Firming and lifting benefits also come courtesy of Adenosine, while Panthenol softens and Allantoin soothes. Combined with botanical extracts, this facial pudding delivers a super-sized serving of antioxidants to neutralize the almost inevitable free radical damage from daily life.

THE MIND BEHIND: As the last step of a routine before SPF or makeup, Peach & Lily founder, Alicia Yoon wanted the Matcha Pudding Antioxidant Cream to also have the perfect finish. The decadent, light texture sinks right into skin, leaving it perfectly calm, with a matte glow finish (and perfectly primed for makeup). For those with oilier skin, an extra benefit is decreased shine. For those with drier skin, this cream quenches skin thirst and hydrates without being waxy, heavy or greasy.

THE PEACH & LILY PROMISE: Caring for your skin can be overwhelming. You might be tired of the skincare guessing game as you try to figure out what will work for you. You want products that deliver dramatic results, but you're worried they will be too harsh or make you break out. You want delightful textures, but want to avoid chemicals and harmful ingredients. Peach & Lily is all too familiar with trial and error, trade-offs, and compromises when it comes to skincare.

The innovative beauty brand created the Peach & Lily skincare collection to deliver everything you want without worries or guesswork. Pushing the limits of innovation by combining breakthrough research and proven skincare traditions, you will enjoy dramatic results, delivered in a radically safe and delightful way. Peach & Lily formulas feature powerful, clinically-proven ingredients, thoughtfully crafted to be gentle and safe. In short, you get big results with a beautiful experience, and zero compromises. Who says you can't have it all?

$39.00","We've all been there: already in bed and too tired to get up or heading straight from the gym to a night out. Because skincare doesn't have to be all or nothing, here's a beauty hack you can use in place of almost every step in your daily routine. Peach & Lily's Lazy Day's All-in-One Moisture Pads deliver the effects of a toner, essence and moisturizer in just one swipe. Packed with vitamins and antioxidants thanks to Ceramides, Hyaluronic Acid, Spinach, Broccoli, Carrot, Pomegranate, and Bamboo Extracts, these hydrating pads act like a green juice for your face, imparting rich, refreshing nourishment. Perfect for lazy or super busy- days (and everything in between), you'll look dewy, nourished and highlighted from within. Turns out, some things are not too good to be true.

RECOMMENDED FOR:
Dark spots, uneven tone
Dullness, dehydration (Alicia's Tip: dehydrated skin lacks moisture. Oily skin types can have dehydrated skin, too)
Skin lacking nourishment

WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU: Combined in a soaked moisture pad that delivers a bevy of skincare benefits deep into pores, this unique formula refreshes and hydrates, leaving skin looking radiant. Starring Ceramides to help strengthen the skin barrier, Hyaluronic Acid to bind moisture to the skin, Bamboo Extract to soothe and hydrate, along with superfood ingredients- Spinach, Broccoli, Carrot, and Pomegranate Extracts- which blast the skin with a bevy of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, you'll feel nourished in no time. No shimmer, glitter or makeup here, just a dewy glow that brings to mind just-stepped-out-of-the-shower-freshness. With all this skin goodness, who needs a foundation?

THE MIND BEHIND: When it comes to skincare, consistency brings radiance. So many clients of Peach & Lily founder and esthetician, Alicia Yoon, would remark that one of the biggest challenges is to stick to a good routine. In real life, late nights or rushed early mornings happen, and sometimes the bathroom sink is simply too far away. A common refrain is ""I'll start tomorrow."" Well, tomorrow can be today. Thanks to these fast-acting pads, you'll be armed to stay hydrated and nourished, everyday, consistently. Keep this travel-friendly jar by your side for those days you just can't be bothered, and your skin will thank you for years to come.
