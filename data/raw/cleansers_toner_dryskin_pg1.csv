For those with oily and acne-prone skin, using both together can help you fight what Alicia calls the ""blackhead, whitehead and acne curve."" As per the Peach & Lily philosophy, they set out to create formulas that work well alone and in combination, and can be mixed and matched based on your unique skin type and needs.

THE PEACH & LILY PROMISE: Caring for your skin can be overwhelming. You might be tired of the skincare guessing game as you try to figure out what will work for you. You want products that deliver dramatic results, but you're worried they will be too harsh or make you break out. You want delightful textures, but want to avoid chemicals and harmful ingredients.

Skin lacking nourishment

WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU: Combined in a soaked moisture pad that delivers a bevy of skincare benefits deep into pores, this unique formula refreshes and hydrates, leaving skin looking radiant.

No shimmer, glitter or makeup here, just a dewy glow that brings to mind just-stepped-out-of-the-shower-freshness. With all this skin goodness, who needs a foundation?

THE MIND BEHIND: When it comes to skincare, consistency brings radiance. So many clients of Peach & Lily founder and esthetician, Alicia Yoon, would remark that one of the biggest challenges is to stick to a good routine. In real life, late nights or rushed early mornings happen, and sometimes the bathroom sink is simply too far away. A common refrain is ""I'll start tomorrow."" Well, tomorrow can be today. Thanks to these fast-acting pads, you'll be armed to stay hydrated and nourished, everyday, consistently.

$15.00","SKINFOOD's Peach Sake Toner is a refreshing toner made with rice sake and peach extracts, rich in vitamins A and C, which minimize shine and the appearance of pores.

Peaches contain significant vitamins and minerals which promote healthy skin. Peaches are rich in vitamin A and vitamin C, which are antioxidants that help reduce free radical damage and possess anti-aging benefits. Naturally occurring acid in the skin helps prevent acne and repair acne scars. The organic acid found in peaches can boost skin acid's rejuvenating effects. Finally, pectin, a type of fiber, is found in the skin of peaches and helps to tone and firm skin.

Sake, a wine made from rice, clears skin by facilitating blood circulation, while the alcohol also tightens pores and controls sebum production. Geishas, traditional artisans and performers in Japan, would add sake to bath water for softer, brighter skin. Following their fashion, sake spas offer luxurious sake baths and treatments. The fermentation process produces kojic acid, which has brightening effects on skin. The yeast used in the process also contains peptides, which are chains of amino acids that play a role in effective collagen production.
