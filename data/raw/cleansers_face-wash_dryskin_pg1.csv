WHAT IT IS: Getting the basics right can be so difficult but it doesn't have to be! The Peach & Lily Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser makes it so easy to get the basics right, cleansing skin down to its pores without stripping skin dry or causing irritation. Formulated with soothing ingredients like chamomile and camellia extracts and without things like sulfates or toxins or animal testing, this gentle face wash starts as a clear gel and lathers into a soft, milky foam, helping dissolve light, everyday makeup and deeply cleansing skin, while a pH of 5.5 helps keep your natural skin barrier intact.

RECOMMENDED FOR:
All skin types
Acne-prone, mature, and/or sensitive skin in particular
Irritation, redness, and inflammation
Rough texture and dullness
Dehydrated, uncomfortable tightness

WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU: Peach & Lily's Power Calm Hydrating Cleanser starts with Deionized Water, water that's been run through a filtration system to remove mineral ions, leaving only clean, pure water. Camellia, Chamomile, and Centella Asiatica Extracts help soothe skin, while Peach Extract brings its wealth of vitamins and minerals to help nourish and brighten skin, so skin is left deeply cleansed without being stripped dry or irritated. Formulated without sulfates or toxins, this lightweight, gel cleanser has a pH of 5.5 and a faint herbal scent that imparts a sense of calm, starting any skincare routine on the right, gentle note.

THE MIND BEHIND: Peach & Lily's founder, Alicia Yoon, is a celebrated esthetician and a leading skincare expert. In her experience, when cleansing is done improperly, skin tends to go awry, becoming irritated or producing more oil, while getting cleansing right helps make the rest of a skincare routine much easier because proper cleansing helps keep skin balanced and free of irritation, the skin's natural barrier left intact. With this in mind, Alicia worked with leading labs in Korea to develop a cleanser that would not only cleanse gently but also help hydrate, nourish, and balance skin. Discover the skin-changing benefits of a proper cleanser with Peach & Lily's Power Calm Hydrating Gel Cleanser for yourself!
