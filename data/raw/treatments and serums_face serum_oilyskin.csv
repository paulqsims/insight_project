Turns your moisturizer into a de-aging powerhouse. Clinique's breakthrough Fresh Pressed Clinical Daily + Overnight Boosters with Pure Vitamins C 10% + A (Retinol) are freshly activated to deliver prescription-level results against visible wrinkles.* Simply mix a few pumps with your favorite Clinique moisturizer-Vitamin C in the morning, Vitamin A at night. Enjoy a potent de-aging boost without changing the moisturizer you love.

Every day, Vitamin C 10% works on skin's surface to instantly brighten. See remarkably even-toned and retexturized skin with continued use.

Every night, Vitamin A (Retinol) penetrates deeply into skin's surface. Over time, skin appears revitalized, lines and wrinkles 're-filled,' youthful tone recaptured.

Key Ingredients / Technology:

Clinique's guiding dermatologist recommends using topical Vitamins C & A together for their synergistic power. Fresh is key-they naturally degrade when exposed to oxygen and lose their effectiveness. Clinique's exclusive stay-fresh packaging protects their full potency until activation for maximum results.
Pure Vitamin C 10% powder concentrate is sealed in an airproof chamber
Pure Vitamin A (Retinol) liquid concentrate is encapsulated in a double-walled chamber

Activating the package releases the Pure Vitamin into the vial's de-aging soothing emulsion, which is bursting with powerful revitalizing ingredients. Once activated, each Booster is at maximum potency for 7 days/nights, but can be used up to 14 days/nights.

Vitamin A (Retinol) is so powerful that it actively transforms skin. You may experience a little dryness, redness or peeling during the first few weeks of use-all common indications that Vitamin A is working. To smooth your skin's transition to a nightly Vitamin A (Retinol) routine, Clinique recommends using a daily moisturizer and an extra gentle, sulfate-free cleanser. And be sure to wear sunscreen every day since your skin may be more photosensitive.

Allergy tested. 100% Fragrance free. No parabens. No phthalates. Just happy skin. Non-acnegenic. For all skin types.

*Proven Results: Based on a 12-week clinical study using Vitamin C 10% in AM and Vitamin A (Retinol) in PM, vs. nighttime use of a leading prescription ingredient:
First AM use: Radiance instantly boosted
In 1 week: Smoothness and texture improved
In 4 weeks: Fine facial wrinkles visibly reduced
In 12 weeks: Skin tone is more even & deep-set wrinkles and forehead lines dramatically reduced

$39.00","We've all been there: already in bed and too tired to get up or heading straight from the gym to a night out. Because skincare doesn't have to be all or nothing, here's a beauty hack you can use in place of almost every step in your daily routine. Peach & Lily's Lazy Day's All-in-One Moisture Pads deliver the effects of a toner, essence and moisturizer in just one swipe. Packed with vitamins and antioxidants thanks to Ceramides, Hyaluronic Acid, Spinach, Broccoli, Carrot, Pomegranate, and Bamboo Extracts, these hydrating pads act like a green juice for your face, imparting rich, refreshing nourishment. Perfect for lazy or super busy- days (and everything in between), you'll look dewy, nourished and highlighted from within. Turns out, some things are not too good to be true.

RECOMMENDED FOR:
Dark spots, uneven tone
Dullness, dehydration (Alicia's Tip: dehydrated skin lacks moisture. Oily skin types can have dehydrated skin, too)
Skin lacking nourishment

WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU: Combined in a soaked moisture pad that delivers a bevy of skincare benefits deep into pores, this unique formula refreshes and hydrates, leaving skin looking radiant. Starring Ceramides to help strengthen the skin barrier, Hyaluronic Acid to bind moisture to the skin, Bamboo Extract to soothe and hydrate, along with superfood ingredients- Spinach, Broccoli, Carrot, and Pomegranate Extracts- which blast the skin with a bevy of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, you'll feel nourished in no time. No shimmer, glitter or makeup here, just a dewy glow that brings to mind just-stepped-out-of-the-shower-freshness. With all this skin goodness, who needs a foundation?

THE MIND BEHIND: When it comes to skincare, consistency brings radiance. So many clients of Peach & Lily founder and esthetician, Alicia Yoon, would remark that one of the biggest challenges is to stick to a good routine. In real life, late nights or rushed early mornings happen, and sometimes the bathroom sink is simply too far away. A common refrain is ""I'll start tomorrow."" Well, tomorrow can be today. Thanks to these fast-acting pads, you'll be armed to stay hydrated and nourished, everyday, consistently. Keep this travel-friendly jar by your side for those days you just can't be bothered, and your skin will thank you for years to come.

RoC The Retinol Authority: Pure, Potent, Clinically Proven.

Pure RoC Retinol: RoC was first to discover the method for stabilizing Retinol-creating pure RoC Retinol, a more potent Retinol than any Retinol derivative. 27 years and 35 patents later, we continue to lead the way in Retinol technology today.

Potent Formulations: Most Retinol products degrade and lose efficacy over time. Every pure RoC Retinol formula contains high potency Retinol, is scientifically crafted and clinically tested to ensure it stays stable with continued use, delivering Retinol equally as potent from the first drop to the last.

Clinically Proven Results: RoC has over 175 clinical and safety studies-making it one of the most studied Retinol brands available today. RoC is also one of the only skincare brands to have a one-year clinical study, proving that the benefits of RoC Retinol do not plateau-actually becoming more effective with continued use. That's why year after year, RoC is recognized by industry leaders, dermatologists and beauty editors for best-in-class effectiveness.","Cyclopentasiloxane, Ethylhexyl Cocoate, Dimethiconol, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Retinol, Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol, Ceramide NP, Phenoxyethanol.",4.7,,189 Reviews,https://www.ulta.com/retinol-correxion-line-smoothing-night-serum-capsules?productId=pimprod2012772,1

L'Or√©al Revitalift Derm Intensives Night Serum with 0.3% Pure Retinol is L'Oreal's most potent and has their highest concentration of pure retinol. Why choose pure retinol?

It is potent and effective from the first drop to the last - giving you powerful anti-aging results with continued use. 

Starting a Pure Retinol Routine: This product contains high potency retinol which may cause initial redness, tingling or dryness which is normal even if you've been using Retinol before. Your skin may need time to get used to this powerful serum, so it¬øs important to introduce it gradually. Use a couple of times a week at first and slowly move to nightly use. Read product carton before use.

SPF Lotion Reminder: when using retinol products, always use an SPF Lotion the morning after, such as Revitalift Triple Power SPF 30 Lotion.

Key Ingredients:
Pure Retinol - a top dermatologist recommended anti-aging ingredient proven to fight key signs of aging such as wrinkles, even deep ones (with many retinols available in skincare, those that don't say pure are likely a derivative and less potent)
Benefits:
Night Serum with 0.3 percent pure retinol visibly reduces wrinkles, even deep ones

Skin Types:
All Skin Types

What It Does:
Clinique's ""damage eraser"" with patented CL302 Equalizer Technology is now more concentrated, with boosted technology to deliver dramatic brightening results - yet is still gentle enough for all skin types.
Now with double the dose, this formula features our proprietary brightening molecule for a more even skin tone plus improves the look of dark spots, age spots, and acne scars.
Interrupts future dark spots, too.

Key Ingredients/Technology:
CL302 Equalizer Technology targets dark spots in two ways: corrects with the CL302 Complex and interrupts future ones with the Interrupter Complex.

CL302 Complex: with 2X the brightening dose helps visibly reduce dark spots and discoloration. It includes the following:
UP302 (dimethoxytolyl propylresorcinol): A targeted brightening molecule inspired by border silver, or dianella ensifolia, a botanical known in traditional Chinese medicine for its antioxidant properties.
Ascorbyl glucoside: Helps reduce the appearance of discoloration.
Glucosamine: Weakens the bonds that hold dead skin cells together to encourage the departure of cells containing melanin.
Yeast extract: Clinique's ""cluster buster"" breaks up (exfoliates) large clusters of pigment into smaller particles so they're less visible.
Salicylic acid: Gently sloughs off the uppermost layers of the skin to reveal fresher, more even tone skin.

Interrupter Complex: with a cocktail of soothing ingredients helps minimize irritation to interrupt future hyperpigmentation. It includes the following:
Gyokuro (camellia sinensis leaf) extract: A green tea harvested with a special method in Japan that helps quell irritation.
Mulberry root extract: Rich in antioxidants that help counter free-radical damage that causes irritation.
Rice bran extract: A potent anti-oxidant and anti-irritant, and helps to prevent future dark spots by defending skin against damaging free radicals.
Complex of olive squalene, barley extract, and wheat germ extract: Helps nourish and replenish skin with hydration.
Dipotassium glycyrrizate (licorice extract): Acts as an anti-irritant that reduces the negative visible effects of stress and pollution.

THE MIND BEHIND: Peach & Lily's founder, Alicia Yoon, is a celebrated esthetician and a leading skincare expert. Inspired by Asia's ""glass skin"" beauty paradigm, she set out to create a product that wasn't about surface-level results, but instead transformed skin from within. With the goal of delivering a poreless, refined and radiant complexion (that that can't be faked with laser treatments or a quick fix), Alicia worked with cutting edge labs in Korea to develop a truly game-changing serum. Meant to reveal skin that is happy and healthy from the inside out, The Glass Skin Refining Serum will give your visage a new lease on life. Discover the magic of having skin that's so well cared for that it looks like pristine glass.

You want products that deliver dramatic results, but you're worried they will be too harsh or make you break out. You want delightful textures but want to avoid chemicals and harmful ingredients. Peach & Lily is all too familiar with trial and error, trade-offs, and compromises when it comes to skincare.

The innovative beauty brand created the Peach & Lily skincare collection to deliver everything you want without worry or guesswork. Pushing the limits of innovation by combining breakthrough research and proven skincare traditions, you'll enjoy dramatic results, delivered in a radically safe and delightful way.
